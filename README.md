# Fynd AI Engineering Intern – Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the **AI Engineering Intern – Fynd** assignment.

It includes:

- A **User Feedback App** (Streamlit) – customers submit ratings & reviews and get an AI-generated reply
- An **Admin Dashboard** (Streamlit) – internal view of all feedback + analytics
- A **prompting notebook** for **Task 1 – Rating Prediction via Prompting**
- A short **report (PDF)** summarizing the approach and results

🧪 Task 1 – Rating Prediction via Prompting
Notebook: fynd_task1_rating_prompting.ipynb

Goal:
Given a Yelp review, predict a rating from 1–5 stars using prompting only, returning:

json
Copy code
{
  "predicted_stars": 4,
  "explanation": "Brief reasoning for the assigned rating."
}
Dataset
Kaggle Yelp Reviews dataset (subset)

Columns used: text (review), stars (actual rating 1–5)

Cleaning & Sampling
Removed rows with missing stars or text

Kept ratings between 1 and 5

Lowercased text, removed URLs, punctuation and extra spaces

Sampled a subset of reviews for evaluation

Prompt Variants
Three prompt styles were tested:

Prompt 1 – Strict rater

Short rubric, clear mapping 1–5

Force JSON output

Prompt 2 – Step-by-step reasoning

First classify sentiment and intensity

Then map to rating 1–5

Still forced JSON output

Prompt 3 – Aspect-based

Ask model to separately consider food, service, ambiance, price

Then decide final rating from 1–5

Force JSON output

Each prompt instructs the model to return only JSON with predicted_stars and explanation.

Evaluation
For each prompt we measured:

Accuracy – (predicted_stars == actual)

JSON validity rate – share of responses parsed successfully as valid JSON

Example summary (for the sampled set used in my run):

Prompt	Accuracy	JSON Validity
Prompt 1	0.38	0.11
Prompt 2	0.36	0.10
Prompt 3	0.38	0.09

Short Discussion
All three prompts achieved similar accuracy, around 35–38% on the sampled reviews.

Prompt 1 (simplest) was already competitive, showing that a clear rubric works well.

Prompt 2 and Prompt 3 sometimes produced overly long explanations or slightly off-format JSON, which reduced JSON validity rate.

The main failure modes:

Confusing mixed reviews (good food / bad service)

Being too generous with 4–5 star ratings

Rarely outputting invalid JSON (extra text around the JSON or different key name)

💻 Apps Overview
1. User Feedback App – user_app.py
Features:

User selects a rating (1–5) and writes a short review

App calls Gemini API to generate:

A friendly response to the user

It also stores:

rating

review

AI reply

Recent feedback is shown in a table for the user’s session

2. Admin Dashboard – admin_app.py
Features:

Loads feedback.csv generated by the user app

Shows a raw feedback table:

user rating

review text

AI reply

AI summary (optional)

AI-recommended actions (optional)

Summary analytics:

total number of feedback entries

average rating

count of low ratings (≤ 2)

Rating distribution chart

Latest feedback section

The admin dashboard and user app both read from / write to the same data source (feedback.csv).
