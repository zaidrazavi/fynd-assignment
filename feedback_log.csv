3,kind a like the environment but the food taste is not as expected,"Thank you for your 3-star rating and for sharing your feedback! We're glad to hear you enjoyed the environment, but we're truly sorry that the food taste wasn't what you expected. Your comments are very valuable to us as we always strive to improve.",,
1,not expected price is very high and taste is not good,"Thank you for your feedback. We're sorry to hear that the price was higher than expected and that you didn't enjoy the taste of your meal. We appreciate you letting us know.

We'd love for you to give us another try, and perhaps exploring a different dish on our menu might better suit your preferences.",Unexpectedly high prices and poor taste resulted in a 1/5 rating.,"**Action:** Implement a mandatory daily ""Plate and Taste Test"" before each service.

**Explanation:** The Head Chef (or a designated senior kitchen staff member) must plate and taste every item (or a significant rotating selection) from the menu to ensure consistent flavor, seasoning, portioning, and presentation against established recipe standards. This directly addresses the fundamental issue of ""taste is not good"" by building a critical quality control step into daily operations, which is foundational to improving customer perception of value for money."
4,"great food and nice vibes just the price is little too high
",Thanks so much for your 4-star rating! We're delighted to hear you enjoyed the great food and nice vibes. We appreciate your feedback regarding the price.,"Excellent food and atmosphere, but overpriced.","**Action:** Introduce a limited-time or regular fixed-price (prix fixe) menu or a special combination deal that offers a multi-course experience at a perceived better value than ordering à la carte.

**Reasoning:** The customer clearly enjoys the ""great food and nice vibes"" (4/5 rating), indicating the core product and atmosphere are strong. The only detractor is the perception that ""the price is a little too high."" Instead of lowering prices across the board (which can impact profitability and food quality), offering a structured value option allows the restaurant to maintain its current pricing while directly addressing the value concern. A prix fixe menu or combo deal gives customers a clear sense of getting ""more for their money"" by bundling items together at a set price, without cheapening the overall brand or compromising the quality that earned the ""great food"" compliment."
5,very good taste,Thank you for your 5-star rating! We're delighted to hear you enjoyed the taste so much.,Very good taste.,"Here's one clear, practical action:

**Enhance the visual presentation/plating of all dishes.**

**Why:** The customer has unequivocally praised your core product: the taste. To elevate the overall dining experience from ""very good taste"" to ""exceptional"" and encourage more comprehensive reviews, ensure that the visual appeal of your dishes consistently matches their deliciousness. This reinforces quality, adds perceived value, and creates a more memorable, shareable experience for the diner."
2,average food service is also not as expected just like the ambience of the cafe ,"Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're truly sorry to hear that your experience with our food, service, and the cafe's ambiance didn't meet your expectations.

We'll be sure to discuss your comments regarding the service with our team, as we're always striving to improve our guest experience. We hope you might consider giving us another chance in the future.","The food was average, and the service and ambiance were disappointing.","The restaurant should:

**Implement mandatory, daily pre-shift briefings for all front-of-house staff, focusing on 2-3 specific service standards each day (e.g., proactive greetings, checking back within two bites, anticipating guest needs) and role-playing scenarios to deliver a more attentive and engaging guest experience.**

**Rationale:** ""Service is also not as expected"" is a critical failure point that impacts the entire guest perception, including food and ambience. This action is practical, immediate, and targets the core issue of inconsistent and underwhelming service by establishing clear expectations and practicing their execution. Improving service can also elevate the perception of ""average food"" and contribute positively to the overall ""ambience."""
